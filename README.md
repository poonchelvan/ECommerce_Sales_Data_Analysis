Analyzing Simulated E-commerce Sales Data

This project generates synthetic e-commerce sales data, performs validation, computes statistics, and creates visualizations.


Tasks for this project:

1. Generate or load a synthetic dataset containing at least 365 daily entries, including columns for Date, Product Category (at least 3 types), Units Sold, Revenue, and Customer Rating (1-5). Use libraries like NumPy or Pandas for generation if creating synthetic data.


2. Perform basic data validation and cleaning: check for and report (do not necessarily fix, unless needed for analysis) any missing values or incorrect data types in the primary numerical columns (Units Sold, Revenue).


3. Calculate and report the descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, maximum) for the 'Revenue' column.


4. Aggregate the data to calculate total monthly revenue across all categories. Create a simple line plot showing the trend of this total monthly revenue over the 12 months.


5. Calculate and report the frequency distribution of the 'Customer Rating' column. Create a simple bar chart visualizing this distribution.
